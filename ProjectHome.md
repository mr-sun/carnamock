This project came from the need to test legacy code with Borland C++ Builder 6.

Aims:

  * to be lightweight.
  * to avoid heavy template code.
  * to compile in Borland C++ Builder 6.

If you have access to a better compiler don't hesitate to use another mocking framework!

Other frameworks:
  * [google mock](http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/)
  * [hippomocks](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/hippomocks)
  * [mockpp](http://mockpp.sourceforge.net/)
  * [mockitopp](http://code.google.com/p/mockitopp/)
  * [amop](http://code.google.com/p/amop/)


Special Thanks:

We would like to thank Audaces (http://www.audaces.com.br) for their support while developing carnamock. This project just wouldn´t be feasible without their help, and willingness to make it Open Source. Thanks!


The name:

Carnamock gets its name from the fact that we worked hard on it during our Carnaval (Brazilian Carnival). It wasn´t easy to trade the party for mocking objects in C++, let me tell you.... :-)
